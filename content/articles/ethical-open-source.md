  As algorithms and complex processes are applied to ever greater swathes of
  human endeavor, open source code--the idea that anyone can inspect a program--
  becomes an ethical imperative.  This is especially true of domains we expect
  to be open and fair, such as law, as well as those where it is logically
  necessary, as in reproducibility of science.  Unfortunately, this principle
  has yet to be understood, internalized, and approached as best practice.
