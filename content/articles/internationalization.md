Internationalized and localized applications reach more markets, help more people, and improve UX compared to single-language apps.  Moreover, i18n (as it is typically abbreviated), can serve development teams in one important time-saving way:  static content management, even if no language translation is ever performed.  Internationalization is a win-win, paying for its own development time.  The real winners?  Happier users and a more inclusive web.
